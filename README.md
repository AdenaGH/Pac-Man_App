**Instructions For Playing:**
Use a swipe motion (click and drag for simulators) to move your sprite around the screen. Remove all yellow dots to win. If you collide with any of the brightly colored ghosts, you lose a life, and if you get to 0 lives you lose. If you eat a large pellet and the ghosts turn dark blue, you can eat them and they will return to spawn before returning to normal.
